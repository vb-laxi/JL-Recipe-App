# JL-Recipe-App
Recipe app put together by Jonah Capers and Lianet Caldero for Mobile Development Spring 2025.


Basic app set up with firebase server functions and basic (although buggy) Firebase authentication setup with an attempt at Google Sign in

Users are welcomed into the app, and can search and view recipes pushed onto the server by other users.
User can then create their own post with a title, image, ingredients and steps. 
User must be authenticated to post.
They will be redirected to a sign-in page prompting for Google Sign-In using firebase.

Hours were spent on Firebase authentication not working properly, and is still the main issue in the code. 
The basic app and server should work fine, but signing in with Google proved difficult. 

Will be improved on in the future.
